# speedrun-red-classic

This is a temporary space to begin working on a pokemon red classic route for PB Attempts focused on achieving a time of sub 2 hours or better. Additionally, this should also include: a beginner guide focusing on completing runs often with most nidoran; a race route that adapts to any nidoran; HP Strats with something near a 50/24 risk threshold (willing to take a 50% risk to save 24 seconds); some offensive and defensive ranges that will be functional (e.g. 0-7 def versus 8-15 def; rather than a precise range for each DV); DSUM charts; and whatever else is thought of.
