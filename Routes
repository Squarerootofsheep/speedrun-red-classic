# Red-Blue Any% Glitchless (Classic) Routes 

* [Beginner Route](beginner-route/)
* [Advanced Route](advanced-route/)
* [Race Route](race-route/)
* [Squirtle Route](squirtle-route/)

## What route do I choose?
- Different routes exist to optimize how much time it takes to get a specific goal time. The way you play to get a sub 2:10 time efficiently is much different than the way you play for a sub 2:00 time.
- The beginner route is recommended if you first start out. It is focused toward being able to complete as many runs as possible, which is great for learning the game.
- The advanced route is mainly focused toward goal times of 1:57/1:58 or better, where you are likely to have to consistently go for more risky red bar strategies.
- The race route is for races where risk is higher than the beginner route, but includes revives so that most runs can be completed.
- The squirtle route is for fun, but can achieve times near or maybe even below the 2 hour mark. 
- Most runs will be using NidoranM as the main. Nido's ATK DV generally should be 5+ for PB attempts.
- If running on the approved emulator, you MUST either Hard Reset before each individual attempt or capture the entire emulator window including [icon] FileName.zip <PSR> - Gambatte-Speedrun (r717).
